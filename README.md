# Stream your consciousness

> A Vue.js demo project. A small micro blog made with vue.js 2.2 This is a pure client-side solution without a backend server. This project explores the next options when you leave the very basic examples given in the vue.js docs. The project is a micro blog which has small articles that are sorted and grouped by date. Articles can have tags as metadata. The project uses a custom store class to read and write data to localstorage. Vuex as a full storage solution was a bit too much for this setup.

I integrated quill.js, a rich text editor, implemented for Vue via https://github.com/davidroyer/vue2-editor Most options are disabled to prevent XSS.
There is also the date picker plugin to change the date https://github.com/charliekassel/vuejs-datepicker Other date pickers caused trouble with the time settings in the userÂ´s browser. This one does it right. To be on the safe side I integrated also https://momentjs.com/ for the date comparision.
